Conversations with an alien is a small escape room for Oculus VR (quest and rift) where you talk to an alien in order to get the ship on the way. 
currently it has only one puzzle to it.

From a technological standpoint, this project attempts to create an easy wrapper for the voice SDK to enable game flow through multiple branching dialogs in various game stages and smart responses to user's utterances that enhances wit.ai's capabilities.


How to use:

Install the APK and run the app on your quest. 
Locomitoin by teleporting around using the B button.
How to talk to the alien: talk by pointing at the cube and pressing the grip once to select it and the trigger button when you want to talk to them.


TBD and vision : In future iterations of this prototype there will be:

A spaceship environment
More conversation lines with the alien
Better movement controls (teleport beam will only appaer when pressing the B button)
Better interface to speaking with the Alien, with a more intuitive AI. the button method was used due to facebook's 20 seconds recording , 2 seconds idle and the privacy limitations of continuous recording of audio. we will consider how to go around this issue in the future.

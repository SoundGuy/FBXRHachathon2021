Conversations with an alien is a small escape room for Oculus VR (quest and rift) where you talk to an alien in order to get the ship on the way. 
currently it has only one puzzle to it.

From a technological standpoint, this project attempts to create an easy wrapper for the voice SDK to enable game flow through multiple branching dialogs in various game stages and smart responses to user's utterances that enhances wit.ai's capabilities.
